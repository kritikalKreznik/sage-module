These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><caption>Table

you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage&rsquo;s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You&rsquo;re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn two accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you&rsquo;d have to pick once more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you&rsquo;re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you&rsquo;re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you&rsquo;re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon&rsquo;s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don&rsquo;t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you&rsquo;ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"lFvwi":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"kYgv0":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"oXSpX":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.zMEmFvF2y1ujw3WF","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Spellcasting","level":1},"blvEK":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1672595108636,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"lFvwi":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"kYgv0":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"oXSpX":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.zMEmFvF2y1ujw3WF","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Spellcasting","level":1},"blvEK":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167101133,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"lFvwi":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"kYgv0":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"oXSpX":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.zMEmFvF2y1ujw3WF","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Spellcasting","level":1},"blvEK":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"nUTTi":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167176783,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"lFvwi":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"kYgv0":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"oXSpX":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.zMEmFvF2y1ujw3WF","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Spellcasting","level":1},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167181958,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"lFvwi":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"kYgv0":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167182642,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167183887,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167191791,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"yRRc6":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"Ufegz":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167205935,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"Ufegz":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1},"HHfcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167588910,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"Ufegz":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1},"HHfcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677167643225,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"HHfcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677185555285,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677185555371,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

Join Past cantrip along with your other 4 cantrips.\n<p>† The awakened class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"AyH8s":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"ExFda":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677185677513,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You’ve become a being of pure magic and as such casting spells is second nature to you. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You can substitute any material component with a somatic component, which can be a simple wave of your hand, eliminating the need for a material component pouch when casting spells. Also, you can substitute somatic components with verbal components.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sage, your number of spells per day increases, as does the higher level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Sage Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width:100%\"><caption>Table

At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Additionally, you learn the Join Pasts cantrip.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select one more 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you somewhat gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or item adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Your knowledge of your magic allows you to access uncommon occult spells. You have access to the following spells from the occult list: Empathic Link, Imprint Message, Object Reading, Sage’s Curse. You do not learn any of these spells automatically and must learn them normally.</p>\n<p>If you have either a scroll that allows you to cast an uncommon occult spell, or a detailed set of instructions on how to cast an uncommon occult spell, you can learn it as you would any other spell.</p>\n<h2>Accolade Spells</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re able to channel the true depths of your knowledge into feats of magic known as Accolade spells. Accolade spells are a type of focus spell. Casting an accolade spell costs 1 Focus Point. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to ponder on the nature of reality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You learn three accolade spells of your choice at 1st level, both being from the list of 1st-level Accolade spells the sage has access to.</p>\n<h2>Molded Protection</h2>\n<p>You're able to remold your body and mind freely, altering your strengths and weaknesses on any given day. During your daily preparations pick one of the following saving throws: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Your proficiency rank with the saving throw you pick increases to expert until the next time you make your daily preparations, where you’d have to pick once more. </p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can pick two saving throws instead of one, increasing both to expert.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the master proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re a master or greater in, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can pick one saving throw to increase to the legendary proficiency rank, the other two becoming expert. When you roll a success with a saving throw you’re legendary in, when you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead and when you roll a failure against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Weaponry</h2>\n<p>You're capable of using your magic in place of martial training, spending downtime to remold your body and mind around specific weapons. During character creation, you’re able to grant the Sage trait to up to three weapons. You must physically possess a weapon before you use this class feature. The weapon’s this class feature can affect can either be Simple or Martial weapons. All weapons with the Sage trait are referred to as Sage Weapons. The sage trait is applied to all weapons of the same type, not just the weapons you currently own. So if you lose the weapon, you don’t lose the proficiency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this class feature allows you to later change which weapons you’ve granted the Sage trait to during a period of downtime. You must spend 4 days of downtime to learn a new simple weapon and 8 days of downtime to learn a new martial weapon. Once this is complete, you grant the Sage trait to a new weapon in exchange for losing the ability to do so with an old one. You can never grant the sage trait to more than three weapons at a time, however, if a weapon you find is to have the sage trait without your influence through a manner such as a unique rune, you may use it all the same.</p>\n<p>As you are trained with Sage weapons, you are also trained with any simple, martial or advanced weapon that has the Sage trait. Your unarmed attacks are considered sage weapons and anything that affects sage weapons affects your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h2>Sage Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Focus<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’re a deep wellspring of magic, your mind clear and focused. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve fostered a deeper understanding of your magic. Your proficiency rank for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sagely Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your senses are enhanced by your magic, your awareness nearly peerless. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Sage's Defense<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to preemptively dodge your enemies' attacks, evading incoming blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Sage Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your knowledge guides each strike, your precision lethal. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>The depths of your knowledge has granted you mastery over your magic. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Precognitive Awareness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your perception has become nearly precognitive. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Sage<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your spellcasting to a level that rivals higher beings. Add two 10th-level occult spells which you have access to to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using sage spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your esoteric knowledge, complete control in your hands. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.traditions.occult.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":6,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":14,"start":7,"value":2},{"end":18,"start":15,"value":3},{"start":19,"value":4}],"field":"actor|system.details.level.value"}}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.804,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-12-16T15:28:03.046-05:00","version":{"schema":0.8,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.5.0"}}},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"Yqsi2":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.F4Ht2zAKrHVABoLJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Expert Spellcaster (Sage)","level":7},"w3dcC":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.x7gVl0V4g29YQKer","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Awareness","level":9},"KVGWJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.dT5UVlx1q4Zk08bW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Defense","level":11},"mqzc8":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.z0QiDeJ1jdRVoX0x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Specialization","level":13},"NhgW7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.gPNLsm59t5E3vGQv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Master Spellcaster (Sage)","level":15},"cAq34":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.hXbP5GhNqpftiL0p","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Precognitive Awareness","level":17},"H3qZR":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.Z0lTZxFQfjR5nSn3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Awakened Sage","level":19},"qn7WT":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.pPUXPDOuPQTdyCDZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Legendary Spellcaster (Sage)","level":19},"hhDfI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.MErgMzK3N2zANjDr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Weapon Expertise","level":11},"aTesI":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.wPfHauPvxZ0z7FS9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Accolade Spells","level":1},"UdzjB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.DDzXQwnKh0EbbeH2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Molded Protection","level":1},"AyH8s":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.HVfQvZEtrK58JCOk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sage's Focus","level":5},"ExFda":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-sage.pf2e-sage-features.9HsyFDTBTVGSrFXl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Sagely Weaponry","level":1}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["occ"],"additional":5,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672546159690,"modifiedTime":1677185684391,"lastModifiedBy":"Hl9l8GtfGnrs6zlk"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"tjmGcT11dsofEZos"}
